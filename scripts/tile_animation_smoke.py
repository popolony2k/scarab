"""
Smoke test for the tile animation by time and the tile frame query (plans/MASTER_PLAN.md item V13).

Runs scripts/tile_animation_smoke/main.lua headless once on resources/tilemap/animation/animation.tmx:
every copy of an animated tile shows exactly the frame the virtual clock predicts, every frame
for 11 cycles, also while hidden, masked and off screen; a static tile and a 0 ms cycle never
change; every refusal. See the Lua script's own header.

The script quits itself only if every check passed (exit 0); otherwise it prints each
failure and never quits, so --max-frames runs out and scarab exits 3.

Usage: tile_animation_smoke.py <path-to-scarab-executable>
